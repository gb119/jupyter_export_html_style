# Release Workflow
#
# This workflow builds Python wheels and Conda packages when a new release is published.
#
# Required secrets for publishing:
#   ANACONDA_TOKEN: Anaconda Cloud API token for uploading conda packages
#                   (set as ANACONDA_API_TOKEN environment variable for anaconda-client)
#   PYPI_TOKEN: PyPI API token for uploading Python packages
#               (used with: python -m twine upload --username __token__ --password $PYPI_TOKEN dist/*)
#
# Note: Modern conda-build (3.18+) creates .conda package format by default,
#       but may also create .tar.bz2 packages. This workflow handles both formats.
